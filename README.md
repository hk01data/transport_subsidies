# How much do you benefit from the Public Transport Fare Subsidy Scheme?

Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced the introduction of a public transport subsidy scheme in her maiden policy address on 11th October, 2017.

For each month, the government will provide 25 per cent of transport expenses over HK$400, subject to a cap of HK$300. For example, if a commuter spends HK$600 on transport, they can receive HK$50.
